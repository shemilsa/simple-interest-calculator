ðŸ‘‰ This version of the README keeps it professional, and integrates the **Code Style, Documentation, Testing, Issue Tracker, Code Review, Licensing** sections you wanted.  

Do you want me to also **restructure CONTRIBUTING.md** to align perfectly with this same style so both documents look consistent?
